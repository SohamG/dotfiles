* Soham's Dotfiles

My custom configs for a bunch of tools. 

** Emacs config

- My from-scratch emacs config is [[file:.emacs.d/init.el][here]].
- Emacs is my preferred and only +code editor+ way of life. 

** Shell config

- My ZSH config is in [[file:./.zshrc][this file]] however it has overlap with my [[https://github.com/SohamG/nixcfg][Nix configs]].
- I currently use [[file:./.p10k.zsh][Powerlevel10k]] to style my prompt.

** Miscellaneous Legacy scripts
- My i3/DWM bar widget scripts are in [[file:./.local/scripts]]
- Following paths are no longer in use:
  + .xinitrc (Ew X11)
  + .symbols
  + .config/alacritty
  + .config/nvim (ew neovim)
  + .config/stumpwm
  + .config/wezterm
